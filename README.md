# 🎮 Commodore 64 ASM Examples - Just For The Fun Of It

In this repository, I’m collecting a bunch of small **ASM (assembly) example programs** for the Commodore 64. These are just for experimenting, learning, and having fun—no pressure, no big production, just tinkering like we did back in the day.  

Expect things like:  
- Tiny games  
- Graphics experiments  
- Sprite handling tricks  
- Memory and I/O fun  

All programs are written in **6502 assembly** and are meant to be **educational and playful**.  

Feel free to **clone, study, modify**, or just watch them run and remember the good old C64 vibes.  

Keep it retro, keep it fun! ✨

## 🛠️ Getting Started
- Open the `.asm` files in your favorite C64 assembler (e.g., CBM Studio)  
- Compile and run them in an emulator or on real hardware  
- Watch the magic happen 🎩

> This is all just for the fun of it… and nostalgia. 😉
